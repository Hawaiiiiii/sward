# UnleashedRecomp UI Lab Pivot

Phase 94 pivots SWARD away from treating the clean asset renderer as the parity target. The primary 1:1 lane is now an **UnleashedRecomp UI Lab**: a debug-mode executable path that runs the real UnleashedRecomp runtime, real game files, real CSD/material/movie/render stack, and selected translated-PPC-backed UI states.

The existing `sward_su_ui_asset_renderer.exe` remains useful, but only as a diagnostic sidecar for asset inspection, CSD correlation, and readable reconstruction experiments. It must not be treated as the final Sonic Unleashed UI renderer because it bypasses too much of the actual game runtime.

## Why The Pivot Happened

The clean renderer can draw local DDS, SFD frame, and CSD-derived evidence, but it still has to approximate behavior that the game already executes. UnleashedRecomp already contains the real UI render substrate:

- `Chao::CSD::CScene::Render` and `Chao::CSD::Scene::Render` hooks
- `SWA::CCsdPlatformMirage::Draw` and `DrawNoTex` hooks
- `Hedgehog::MirageDebug::CPrimitive2D` primitive hooks
- real `ui_loading` and `ui_title` CSD modifier paths
- real title-state update wrappers around translated PPC functions
- real movie and CSD shaders in the runtime GPU layer

That means parity work should attach to that substrate instead of reimplementing it screen by screen.

## First Runtime Attachment

This phase adds `UnleashedRecomp/patches/ui_lab_patches.*` as the first SWARD-owned UI Lab module inside the UnleashedRecomp runtime layer.

The module currently provides:

- `--ui-lab`
- `--ui-lab=<target>`
- `--ui-lab-screen <target>`
- `--ui-lab-screen=<target>`
- a curated target table for `TitleLoop`, `TitleMenu`, `Loading`, `SonicHud`, `Result`, `Status`, `Tutorial`, and `WorldMap`
- runtime config overrides that keep the lab path debug-friendly (`ShowConsole`, `SkipIntroLogos`, `DisableAutoSaveWarning`)
- attachment points in `CTitleStateIntro::Update` and `CTitleStateMenu::Update`

This is intentionally not a fake renderer. It is the entry point for driving the real runtime.

## Current Boundary

Implemented now:

- CLI/runtime flag surface for the UI Lab
- initial target taxonomy tied to CSD scene names and recovered source-family ownership
- title intro/menu update hooks that prove the lab can attach to live translated runtime states
- visible ImGui overlay drawn inside the real UnleashedRecomp frame path, after the existing runtime UI draw calls
- overlay target controls for cycling the runtime target table without changing command-line arguments
- overlay route controls and route status for forcing selected UI Lab targets through the real title/menu runtime path
- title-loop to title-menu forcing by injecting the real translated title-state accept input after the intro state is live
- title-menu to loading forcing by pinning the translated title menu cursor to New Game and injecting the real accept input once
- stage-context harness arming via `--ui-lab-stage <token>` / `--ui-lab-stage=<token>` and observation of the real `CGameModeStage::ExitLoading` point for Sonic HUD/tutorial/result targets
- startup update/save/achievement prompt blockers bypassed during UI Lab runs so debug-state inspection is not interrupted by frontend modal checks
- regression tests that guard the runtime-lab contract

Verification note:

- The repo-root `UnleashedRecompLib` does not currently contain generated PPC/shader output, so the tracked root cannot build the full runtime directly.
- The generated clone under `local_build_env/ur103clean` does contain `261` `ppc_recomp.*.cpp` files and `shader_cache.cpp`.
- The Windows build is now unblocked locally by mounting `local_build_env/ur103clean` on a short drive letter, using the Visual Studio Build Tools developer environment, adding `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin` to `PATH`, and passing the resolved vcpkg `dxil.dll` path into CMake.
- The reproducible helper for this is `research_uiux/runtime_reference/tools/build_unleashed_recomp_ui_lab.ps1`.
- `W:\b\ui_lab_runtime\UnleashedRecomp\UnleashedRecomp.exe` builds successfully from the generated clone after the local SDL Clang 22 shim patch and tracked `runtimeobject` link fix.
- A smoke launch from the complete installation root with `--use-cwd --ui-lab-screen title-menu` stayed alive past 8 seconds and was stopped cleanly after the smoke window.
- Static regression coverage guards the UI Lab source/module/CLI/hook/state-forcing contract.

Still ahead:

- visible in-game debug menu or overlay
- CSD-project host creation for non-title screens
- direct stage boot/routing for Sonic HUD/tutorial/result targets after the stage harness observes the correct owner context
- screenshot/vision verification against live UnleashedRecomp frames
- demotion of the clean renderer in docs to diagnostic/evidence-only status everywhere it is still described too strongly

## Immediate Product Direction

The next beats should build on `UiLab` in this order:

1. Screenshot-verify `--ui-lab-screen title-loop`, `--ui-lab-screen title-menu`, and `--ui-lab-screen loading` from the built runtime.
2. Promote the current title/menu/loading route forcing from input injection into direct state-machine requests where the translated PPC owner functions are confidently mapped.
3. Add CSD-project host creation for non-title screens.
4. Add a lightweight stage-context harness for Sonic HUD and tutorial overlays.
5. Add result/status/world-map only after their owner contexts can be created or routed without corrupting save/progression state.

The end-state is a real runtime-backed UI debug executable: Sonic Unleashed UI screens running through the game files and game renderer, not an inspired viewer.
